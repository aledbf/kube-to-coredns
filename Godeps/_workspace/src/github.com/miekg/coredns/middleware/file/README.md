# file

`file` enables serving zone data from a RFC-1035 styled file.

The file middleware is used for "old-style" DNS server. It serves from a preloaded file that exists
on disk.

## Syntax

~~~
file dbfile [zones...]
~~~

* `dbfile` the database file to read and parse.
* `zones` zones it should be authoritative for. If empty the zones from the configuration block
    are used.

If you want to round robin A and AAAA responses look at the `loadbalance` middleware.

TSIG key configuration is TODO; directive format for transfer will probably be extended with
TSIG key information, something like `transfer out [address...] key [name] [base64]`

~~~
file dbfile [zones... ] {
    transfer from [address...]
    transfer to [address...]
    no_reload
}
~~~

* `transfer` enables zone transfers. It may be specified multiples times. *To* or *from* signals
    the direction. Addresses must be denoted in CIDR notation (127.0.0.1/32 etc.) or just as plain
    address. The special wildcard "*" means: the entire internet (only valid for 'transfer to').
* `no_reload` by default CoreDNS will reload a zone from disk whenever it detects a change to the
  file. This option disables that behavior.

## Examples

Load the `miek.nl` zone from `miek.nl.signed` and allow transfers to the internet.

~~~
file miek.nl.signed miek.nl {
    transfer to *
}
